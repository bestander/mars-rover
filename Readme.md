# Profanity Mars Rover

This is an R&D project of 3d printed rover powered by Raspberry Pi and controlled by either a camera over internet orÂ a gamepad.
Video can be streamed via browser, analyzed on Raspberry Pi or remotely in the cloud.

## Body 3D prints 

Project is based on https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1318414 (costs 10$ to obtain the STL files), the schematics and parts lists are incomplete, so it required some research to get all the parts together, I was able to obrain everything through Amazon and will list all the parts here later.

## Wire up

2BD: I'll post pictures here

## Code

Rover controls are written in Python 3, main components:
- USB reciever for gamepad controls (evdev package)
- Pi Camera (RTCBot package)
- Web server (aiohttp package) + React/WebRTC based client
- Motors controls (RPi.GPIO package)


### Quick setup

- Install Raspbian
- Enable I2C and SSH
- sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio
- python3 server.py
- Installing missing native .so files https://blog.piwheels.org/how-to-work-out-the-missing-dependencies-for-a-python-package/ (for cv2)
